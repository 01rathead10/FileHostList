# FileHostList
We are moving ! Go to the official wiki : https://filehostlist.miraheze.org (registrations are open, if you want to be able to edit and help the wiki)

These lists will be kept for easy HTTP checks and for the data that still needs to be ported.

If you're wondering, Miraheze is a non-profit wiki farm. The hosted wikis are ad-free and without any difference from a self-hosted wiki (so consider donating to this amazing project).
